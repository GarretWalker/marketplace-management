                    SHOP LOCAL MARKETPLACE - PROJECT OVERVIEW
                         Chamber Commerce E-Commerce Platform
================================================================================

Date: February 11, 2026
Author: Garret
Status: Concept / Planning Phase

================================================================================
  1. THE IDEA
================================================================================

Build a full e-commerce marketplace website that shows only products from
members of a specific chamber of commerce. The chamber (starting with Cullman
Area Chamber of Commerce) would have a "Shop Local" link on their website that
takes consumers to a marketplace showing physical products from their members
only.

The chamber president originated this idea after seeing existing solutions and
finding them lacking in design quality and ChamberMaster/GrowthZone integration.

The vision extends beyond Cullman — this could be used by all chambers across
Alabama as a white-label, multi-tenant platform.

================================================================================
  2. CHAMBERMASTER / GROWTHZONE INTEGRATION
================================================================================

ChamberMaster (now GrowthZone) is the membership management platform used by
most chambers of commerce. It handles member directories, events, dues/billing,
and communications.

API Details:
- REST-based API
- Base URL format: http://secure2.chambermaster.com/api/associations({Customer_ID})/
- Supports OData-style filtering ($filter, $orderby)
- API access requires a key from GrowthZone (contact: engagement@growthzone.com)
- API access may be a paid add-on depending on the chamber's edition

Key Endpoints:
- /api/contacts — contact records
- /api/memberships/types — membership types
- /api/memberships/all — all memberships
- /api/associations({ID})/members/ — members with status filtering
- /api/associations({ID})/events/details — event data

Member Status Codes:
- 1: Prospective
- 2: Active
- 4: Courtesy
- 8: NonMember
- 16: Inactive
- 32: Deleted

What ChamberMaster Gives Us:
- Business name, address, phone number
- Website URL
- Contact email
- Membership status
- Business category

What ChamberMaster Does NOT Give Us:
- Product catalogs
- Inventory data
- Square/Shopify merchant IDs
- POS system information

================================================================================
  3. THE CORE CHALLENGE: PRODUCT SOURCING
================================================================================

ChamberMaster provides member data but NOT product data. There is no automatic
way to pull a business's inventory using only chamber membership information.

Reality of Local Businesses in Cullman/Rural Alabama:
- ~33% of rural small businesses rely mostly on in-person sales
- ~27% of American small businesses don't even have a website
- Estimated only 10-15% might have a Shopify, Square Online, or similar
  storefront that could be integrated with
- Another 20-30% might use Square or Clover as a POS but have no online store
- Remaining 50-70% are either service businesses (no physical products) or
  retail businesses with no digital product catalog

Conclusion: POS/storefront API integration is a nice-to-have for the minority
of businesses that have them, but the primary product onboarding method MUST be
a manual upload portal.

================================================================================
  4. PRODUCT ONBOARDING STRATEGY
================================================================================

No matter what approach is used, there has to be a moment where the business
owner opts in and connects their store or adds products. This cannot be fully
automated.

Primary Method — Manual Product Upload Portal:
- Business owner logs in (invited via chamber)
- Adds products: name, description, price, photos, quantity
- Should be dead simple — think Facebook Marketplace level ease
- Could leverage AI (Claude vision API) to auto-generate product descriptions
  from photos

Secondary Method — POS/Storefront Integration (for businesses that have them):
- Shopify, Square, WooCommerce, Clover all require OAuth authorization
- Business owner clicks "Connect your store" during onboarding
- Products auto-import and stay synced
- Only works for the ~10-15% with existing online stores

The Onboarding Flow:
1. Pull member list from ChamberMaster API
2. Chamber sends invitation to members (chamber endorsement carries weight)
3. Business owner clicks link, lands on onboarding page
4. Either connects existing storefront via OAuth OR manually adds products
5. Products appear on the marketplace

Critical Insight: The chamber president is the secret weapon for adoption. Her
endorsement and distribution of invitations carries far more weight than cold
outreach from an unknown platform.

================================================================================
  5. EXISTING COMPETITORS
================================================================================

5a. Shop Where I Live / Member Marketplace Inc.
    - Most direct competitor, founded 2017
    - Partners with chambers, Main Street programs, economic development orgs
    - Full e-commerce marketplace with direct checkout
    - Shopify & Square integrations for product import
    - No commission or monthly fees for sellers — 2.9% + $0.30 per order
    - ~17,000 products across their network
    - Active in Iowa (650+ businesses, 5,000+ products), Nevada, Wyoming,
      North Dakota, California, New Mexico, New York, Michigan
    - NOT currently in Alabama
    - Generic WordPress/WooCommerce template design
    - No ChamberMaster integration (manual registration separate from chamber)

5b. Shop Local Digital
    - More focused on discovery, coupons, and vouchers
    - Hyper-local marketplace with SEO focus
    - Less of a direct competitor — more directory/deals than transactions

5c. Member Marketplace Inc. (white-label arm of Shop Where I Live)
    - Can stand up a marketplace within a day
    - Standardized non-customized platform
    - Free and premium tiers available

================================================================================
  6. COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES / DIFFERENTIATORS
================================================================================

The chamber president has already seen existing solutions and rejected them.
Two specific differentiators she wants:

1. BETTER DESIGN
   - Existing solutions look like generic 2018 WordPress templates
   - Building with Angular allows for a modern, polished, premium feel
   - Custom-built UI rather than off-the-shelf theme

2. CHAMBERMASTER INTEGRATION
   - No competitor currently integrates with ChamberMaster
   - Members already in the chamber system — no duplicate registration
   - Chamber admin visibility into who has onboarded and who hasn't
   - If a member drops from the chamber, their store can auto-deactivate
   - Single source of truth for membership status

================================================================================
  7. REVENUE MODEL
================================================================================

Primary: 2-3% transaction fee on each purchase
- No upfront cost to chambers (removes barrier to adoption)
- No monthly fee for businesses
- Everyone's incentives are aligned — platform only makes money when
  members make money
- On top of Stripe's processing fees

Revenue Projections (rough estimates):
- Cullman chamber ~400 members
- If 20% list products (80 businesses)
- Averaging $2,000/month in platform sales each
- Monthly GMV: $160,000
- At 3%: ~$4,800/month from one chamber
- Alabama has 100+ chambers
- 20 chambers at similar volume = ~$96,000/month

Optional future additions:
- Small monthly SaaS fee per chamber ($99-199/month) for infrastructure costs
- Premium listings or featured product placements
- Sponsorship/advertising opportunities for larger businesses

================================================================================
  8. BUSINESS STRUCTURE
================================================================================

- Completely separate venture (NOT part of Daybreak Hunting)
- Sole ownership
- Community-driven mindset — not focused on immediate profit
- Goal: drive local business first, monetize as it scales

================================================================================
  9. TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE
================================================================================

Proposed Tech Stack:
- Frontend: Angular (existing expertise)
- Backend: Node.js (TypeScript) with Express
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Payments: Stripe Connect (marketplace model — each merchant gets connected
  Stripe account, money flows through platform with percentage take)
- Member Sync: ChamberMaster/GrowthZone API
- Product Imports: Shopify API, Square API (OAuth-based)
- Hosting: TBD

Key Technical Considerations:
- Multi-tenant architecture (each chamber gets branded storefront, one
  platform underneath)
- Stripe Connect merchant onboarding is more complex than expected
- ChamberMaster API documentation appears thin — may hit roadblocks
- Sales tax collection and remittance
- Order notification system (email to merchant on purchase)
- Fulfillment is merchant-handled (Etsy model, not Amazon model)

Scope: Physical products only. No services.

================================================================================
  10. DEVELOPMENT PHASES & TIMELINE
================================================================================

Estimated at 10-15 hours/week alongside full-time work.

PHASE 1 — MVP (8-12 weeks)
- ChamberMaster API integration to pull member lists
- Business owner onboarding portal (sign up, add products manually)
- Basic consumer-facing storefront (browse by business, category, search)
- Stripe Connect for payments
- Order notification system (email to merchant when order placed)
- Basic admin dashboard for chamber

PHASE 2 — Polish & Scale (4-8 weeks after MVP)
- Shopify/Square product import integration
- Better product management (inventory tracking, variants)
- White-label theming for other chambers
- Mobile-responsive refinement
- AI-assisted product listing (photo to description via Claude API)

PHASE 3 — Multi-Chamber Rollout (ongoing)
- Multi-tenant admin (each chamber manages their own marketplace)
- Analytics dashboard for chambers
- Marketing tools (featured products, promotions)
- Statewide push through Alabama Association of Chamber of Commerce Executives

================================================================================
  11. NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

- [ ] Decide on a name for the platform
- [ ] Design database schema and data model
- [ ] Map ChamberMaster API integration points in detail
- [ ] Design the merchant onboarding flow (UX wireframes)
- [ ] Set up Stripe Connect account and understand merchant onboarding
- [ ] Build proof of concept to show chamber president
- [ ] Get formal commitment / agreement from Cullman chamber

================================================================================
  12. KEY RISKS & CONSIDERATIONS
================================================================================

- Business owner adoption: Getting busy, non-technical local business owners
  to list products is the #1 challenge
- ChamberMaster API access: May require paid add-on; documentation is thin
- Transaction volume may start very slow — consumer behavior change is hard
- Stripe Connect complexity: Merchant onboarding, tax collection, refunds,
  payouts, compliance
- Competition: Shop Where I Live could expand to Alabama
- Time constraint: Building alongside full-time job and job search
